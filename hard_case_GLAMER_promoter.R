############ This problem case is extracted from promoter dataset: cv+sd.glamer failed on the 10th run of massive-promoter.
############ The cause was that grpreg didn't observe the group constraints for the 15th column and returned 2 non-zero betas and one beta equal to 0
############           **** Group constraint explained: https://pbreheny.github.io/grpreg/articles/web/penalties.html#group-selection
############           ****     "These penalties are sparse at the group level â€“ the coefficients within a group will either all equal zero or none will equal zero."
############ Regularization was added to restore the group constraint (either all betas are zero, or all betas are non-zero in a group)
